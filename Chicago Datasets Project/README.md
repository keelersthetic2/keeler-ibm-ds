This project was created as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and focuses on analyzing crime data from the City of Chicago using Python.
The work includes cleaning and combining datasets, exploring trends across neighborhoods, and visualizing patterns over time.
Libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Folium were used to handle the data and create charts and interactive maps.
The goal was to apply what Iâ€™ve learned so far to a real-world dataset and practice telling a story with data.
